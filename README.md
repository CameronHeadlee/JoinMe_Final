# Join ME: Event Management App
  
## User Story
As someone looking for events, I want to see the description, location, and reviews of the specific happening. I want to be able to share the information about an event interested in attending. Due to the pandemic, I would also want to see any required or recommended safety protocalls relevant to the event as well.

## Description
This app enables community event creators to publicly display their events and provide a quick an easy way for people to share the detail of the event with friends. Registered users also have access to a personalized dashboard which allows them to create, edit and delete events. For COVID precautions, each event is assigned a mask recommendation as well.
